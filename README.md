## Why use fixhw?

The goal of this project is to collect hardware fixes in one place ‚Äî especially for **Linux laptops**, where hardware compatibility can vary.

fixhw focuses on solving issues like:

### üñ•Ô∏è Core hardware issues

- Suspend and hibernation not working
- Wi-Fi hardware not initializing
- Bluetooth not detected or unreliable
- Audio and microphone not working
- Touchpad palm detection failures
- Graphics card problems (e.g., NVIDIA driver issues)
- Webcam not detected or black
- Function keys or hotkeys not working (e.g., brightness, volume)
- External monitors (HDMI / DisplayPort) not detected
- Fingerprint reader not detected
- Printer setup and driver problems

### üîß Optional / advanced issues

- Touchscreen or stylus not working
- Battery not charging or misreporting
- SD card reader not recognized
- Laptop speakers vs. headphone jack switching
- Fan always on or thermal control not working
- Trackpoint or pointing stick issues (e.g., ThinkPad)
- Backlight and keyboard backlight control
- NVMe/SSD not detected or slow performance
- LTE / mobile broadband not working
- HiDPI display scaling issues

These solutions are currently **fragmented across the internet**:

- Scattered across forums and StackExchange posts
- Hidden in obscure distro-specific wikis
- Buried in long Reddit or GitHub issue threads

With a **collaborative model**, fixhw makes solutions more reliable and discoverable:

- ‚úÖ **Pull requests are reviewed** by multiple users
- üëç **Users can upvote working solutions** via thumbs-up reactions
- üß™ **Multiple variations per fix** can be provided and documented

## How do I use fixhw?
