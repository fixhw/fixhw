## Why use hwfix?

The goal of this project is to collect hardware fixes in one place — especially for **Linux laptops**, where hardware compatibility can vary.

hwfix focuses on solving issues like:

- Hibernation not working
- Fingerprint reader not detected
- Wi-Fi hardware not initializing
- Touchpad palm detection failures
- Graphics card issues (e.g., NVIDIA drivers)
- Printer setup and driver issues
- Audio and microphone problems

These solutions are currently **fragmented across the internet**:

- Scattered across forums and StackExchange posts
- Hidden in obscure distro-specific wikis
- Buried in long Reddit or GitHub issue threads

With a **collaborative model**, hwfix makes solutions more reliable and discoverable:

- ✅ **Pull requests are reviewed** by multiple users
- 👍 **Users can upvote working solutions** via thumbs-up reactions
- 🧪 **Multiple variations per fix** can be provided and documented

## How do I use hwfix?
